## Completed Milestones

### v1.0 - Initial Release (2026-01-22 to 2026-01-23)

**Goal:** Create a desktop application that visualizes GSD project structure as an interactive 3D force-directed graph.

**Phases:** 1-6 (22 plans total)
1. Foundation - Electron app with basic 3d-force-graph
2. Graph Rendering - Color-coded nodes, connection-based sizing
3. GSD Parsing - Parse .planning/ structure into nodes
4. State Visualization - Progress colors, current phase highlight
5. Interactions - Details panel, tooltips, fly-to navigation
6. Polish - Live file watching, recent projects, persistence

**Quick Tasks:** 7
- File/directory visual distinction
- Tree panel with bidirectional sync
- Flash animations on file changes
- 2D/3D toggle switch
- Extended color coding (39 extensions)

**Key Deliverables:**
- 3D force-directed graph visualization
- GSD structure parsing (phases, plans, tasks, requirements)
- Real-time file watching with flash animations
- Tree panel synchronized with graph
- Click-to-fly navigation with details panel
