# Roadmap: GSD Viewer

## Overview

Transform a GSD project's .planning/ folder into an explorable 3D force-directed graph. The journey starts with a working Electron shell displaying a basic graph, progresses through GSD-specific parsing and state visualization, adds rich interactions, and finishes with live updates and app polish. Each phase delivers a verifiable capability that builds toward the core value: making project structure visible and navigable.
