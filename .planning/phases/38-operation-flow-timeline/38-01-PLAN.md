# Phase 38: Operation Flow Timeline - Plan

## Goal
User can scrub through operation history to understand Claude's workflow patterns.

## Requirements Addressed
- TIME-01: Horizontal timeline with all GSD operations in chronological order
- TIME-02: Color-coded operation blocks (blue=read, amber=write, green=create, red=delete)
- TIME-03: Operations grouped by file in swimlanes for pattern recognition
- TIME-04: Scrub timeline to see file state at any historical moment
- TIME-05: Pattern detection highlights showing read-then-write sequences
- TIME-06: Zoom in/out on timeline to focus on specific time ranges

## Implementation (Completed in Phase 36)

The timeline-renderer.js was fully implemented as part of Phase 36. It includes:

### Core Features
- Horizontal timeline with time axis and dynamic tick intervals
- Color-coded operation blocks: read=#4488FF, write=#FFAA00, create=#00FF88, delete=#FF3333
- Swimlanes grouping operations by file path
- Mouse wheel zoom and click-drag panning
- Click to scrub with scrub position indicator

### Pattern Detection
- Detects read-then-write sequences on same file within 10 seconds
- Draws purple dashed arcs connecting related operations
- Helps visualize Claude's "read before write" behavior

### Playback Controls
- Play/Pause button for timeline playback
- Variable speed: 1x, 2x, 4x, 8x
- Zoom in/out buttons
- Time range display

### State Management
- Records all operations with timestamps
- Maintains up to 1000 most recent operations
- View range adjusts automatically based on zoom level

## Verification
All success criteria already met by timeline-renderer.js implementation.
