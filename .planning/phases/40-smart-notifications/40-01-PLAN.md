# Phase 40: Smart Notifications - Plan

## Goal
User receives intelligent alerts for significant GSD activity events.

## Requirements Addressed
- NOTF-01: Toast notifications for significant activity events
- NOTF-02: "Claude created N new files in X directory" notifications
- NOTF-03: "Rapid activity in X directory" alerts
- NOTF-04: Settings panel to configure notification types

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Create Notification Renderer Module
- Create `src/renderer/notification-renderer.js`
- Toast notification system with slide-in animation
- Auto-dismiss after configurable duration
- Click to dismiss manually

### Task 2: Implement Pattern Detection
- Track recent operations (30-second window)
- Detect file creation bursts (3+ creates in 30s)
- Detect rapid activity (5+ ops in 10s)
- Group by directory for meaningful alerts
- Cooldowns to prevent notification spam

### Task 3: Create Settings Panel
- Modal dialog for notification preferences
- Toggles for each notification type
- Persist settings to localStorage
- Save/close buttons with overlay backdrop

### Task 4: Wire Up Event Routing
- Update activity-dispatcher to dispatch to notifications
- Initialize notification system on load
- Add toolbar button for settings access

### Task 5: Add Toolbar Button
- Add notification settings button (🔔)
- Click opens settings panel
- Position near other toolbar controls

## Verification
1. Make rapid file changes - see notification toast
2. Create multiple files quickly - see burst notification
3. Click 🔔 button - settings panel opens
4. Toggle settings - preferences persist after reload
