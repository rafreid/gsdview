# Plan 05-01: Click-to-fly navigation

## Goal
Clicking a node smoothly animates the camera to focus on that node.

## Tasks

1. Add click handler to nodes using Graph.onNodeClick()
2. Calculate target camera position based on node position
3. Use Graph.cameraPosition() with transition duration for smooth animation
4. Ensure camera looks at the clicked node after transition

## Implementation

```javascript
// In renderer.js, add after Graph initialization:
Graph.onNodeClick(node => {
  // Calculate distance based on node size
  const distance = 40 + getNodeSize(node, connectionCounts) * 3;

  // Animate camera to node position
  const distRatio = 1 + distance / Math.hypot(node.x, node.y, node.z);
  Graph.cameraPosition(
    { x: node.x * distRatio, y: node.y * distRatio, z: node.z * distRatio },
    node, // lookAt target
    1000 // transition duration ms
  );
});
```

## Verification
- Click any node
- Camera smoothly flies to focus on that node
- Node is centered in view after transition
