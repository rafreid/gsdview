# Phase 39: Context Window Meter - Plan

## Goal
User can see estimated context window usage and what files might fall out.

## Requirements Addressed
- CNTX-01: Progress bar showing estimated context usage percentage
- CNTX-02: List of files currently "in context" based on recent read/write activity
- CNTX-03: Warning indicator when estimated context usage approaches limits
- CNTX-04: Predictions of which files might fall out of context next

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Enhance Context Meter Display
- Add warning indicator element to HTML
- Update renderContextMeter to show warning badges
- Red warning at 80%+ usage, yellow at 50%+

### Task 2: Add "Might Fall Out" Predictions
- Identify oldest files in context (last 3)
- Show "May fall out of context" section when usage > 70%
- Display at-risk files with visual indicator

### Task 3: Improve Files List Display
- Show file paths with age (relative timestamp)
- Section label for "In Context (most recent)"
- Truncate path but show meaningful suffix

### Task 4: Add CSS Styles
- Warning badge styles (red, yellow variants)
- Section label styling
- At-risk file highlighting with left border

## Verification
1. Context bar fills as operations occur
2. Warning badge appears at 50% and 80% thresholds
3. "May fall out" section appears when approaching limit
4. Files show with relative timestamps
