  <what-built>Phase 35 Advanced Features: Context usage bars, parallel agent lanes, and atomic commit markers in the GSD Workflow Diagram view.</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Launch the app: `npm start`
2. Open a GSD project (the GSDv project itself works well)
3. Switch to Diagram view using the tab controls

**Context Usage Bars (DIAG-05):**
4. Look at each stage header - context bars should appear below stage names
5. Verify percentage labels show (e.g., "35%", "50%")
6. Check color coding:
   - Green (0-30%): healthy context usage
   - Yellow (31-50%): normal usage
   - Orange (51-70%): elevated usage
   - Red (71-100%): high usage
7. Hover over context bar - tooltip should show "Context Usage: X%"

**Parallel Agent Lanes (DIAG-06):**
8. Navigate to Discuss stage - if phase has both CONTEXT.md and RESEARCH.md, two agent lanes should appear
9. Navigate to Execute stage - if plans have same wave number, parallel agent lanes should appear
10. Verify agent badges show letters (R=Researcher, E=Executor, D=Discusser) with distinct colors

**Atomic Commit Markers (ARTF-05):**
11. Find SUMMARY artifacts in Execute or Complete stages
12. Look for green checkmark markers on SUMMARY blocks
13. Hover over checkmark - tooltip should show commit message/details
14. Verify max 3 checkmarks shown with "+N more" overflow indicator if applicable

**Responsive Layout:**
15. Toggle tree panel - diagram should adjust smoothly
16. Toggle activity panel - diagram should adjust smoothly
17. Resize browser window - diagram should re-center

**Performance Check:**
18. Navigate through all stages - no lag or stuttering
19. Rapidly toggle between Graph and Diagram views - smooth transitions
20. Check DevTools Performance tab - no memory leaks or excessive CPU usage

Update the requirements file to mark Phase 35 requirements as complete:

1. Change `- [ ] **DIAG-05**` to `- [x] **DIAG-05**`
2. Change `- [ ] **DIAG-06**` to `- [x] **DIAG-06**`
3. Change `- [ ] **ARTF-05**` to `- [x] **ARTF-05**`
4. Update the Traceability table:
   - DIAG-05: Change "Pending" to "Complete"
   - DIAG-06: Change "Pending" to "Complete"
   - ARTF-05: Change "Pending" to "Complete"
5. Update the last updated date
  </action>
  <verify>
Read .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md - all Phase 35 requirements should show [x] and "Complete" status.

Mark Phase 35 and milestone v1.5 as complete:

**STATE.md updates:**
1. Update "Current Position" section:
   - Phase: 35 - Advanced Features & Polish
   - Status: Complete
2. Update Progress bar to show 6/6 phases (100%)
3. Update v1.5 milestone stats with final plan count
4. Update "Last activity" date
5. Update "Session Continuity" section:
   - Stopped at: Completed Phase 35 (v1.5 Milestone Complete)
   - Next action: Create v1.6 roadmap or ship v1.5

**ROADMAP.md updates:**
1. Add success criteria checkmarks to Phase 35 section
2. Add **Completed:** date
3. Update Progress Summary table:
   - v1.5 row: Update plan count and status to "Shipped {date}"
4. Add note that v1.5 milestone is complete
  </action>
  <verify>
Read STATE.md and ROADMAP.md - Phase 35 should show complete, v1.5 milestone should show shipped.
  </verify>
  <done>
STATE.md shows 6/6 phases complete, ROADMAP.md shows Phase 35 complete with checkmarks, v1.5 marked as shipped.
