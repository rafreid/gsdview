# Phase 37: File Heatmap View - Plan

## Goal
User can visualize which files are receiving the most attention through spatial heatmap.

## Requirements Addressed
- HEAT-01: Treemap visualization where rectangle size represents file size
- HEAT-02: Color intensity showing activity frequency (red=hot, blue=cold)
- HEAT-03: Click directory rectangles to drill down
- HEAT-04: Filter heatmap by time range
- HEAT-05: File details on hover tooltip
- HEAT-06: Recent operations list in tooltip

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Enhance Tooltip with Recent Operations
- Track recent operations per file (up to 5 most recent)
- Store operation type and timestamp in activityData
- Display recent operations list in hover tooltip
- Color-code operations (read=blue, write=amber, create=green, delete=red)

### Task 2: Verify Treemap Implementation
- Rectangle size based on file size
- Squarified layout algorithm for optimal aspect ratios
- Labels visible when rectangle is large enough
- Proper text truncation for long filenames

### Task 3: Verify Drill-down Navigation
- Click directory to navigate into it
- Breadcrumb shows current path
- Click breadcrumb items to navigate back
- Root always accessible

### Task 4: Verify Time Range Filtering
- Last Hour filter shows only recent activity
- This Session filter shows session activity
- All Time filter shows accumulated activity
- Filter buttons visually indicate active state

## Verification
1. Hover over file in heatmap - see details + recent operations
2. Click directory - drill down to show children
3. Click breadcrumb - navigate back
4. Toggle time filters - heatmap updates
5. Hot files show red, cold files show blue
