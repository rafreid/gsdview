# v1.3 Requirements Archive

**Milestone:** v1.3 Enhanced Navigation + Smooth Activity
**Shipped:** 2026-01-25
**Status:** All requirements complete

---

## Smart Camera (CAM-*)

- [x] **CAM-01**: Camera automatically follows node when file changes are detected (follow-active)
- [x] **CAM-02**: Zoom preset buttons for overview, focus, and detail levels
- [x] **CAM-03**: Orbit mode auto-rotates camera around current focus for presentations
- [x] **CAM-04**: Path animation smoothly flies camera through selected nodes

## Bookmarks & History (BKM-*)

- [x] **BKM-01**: User can save named bookmarks (camera position + selected node)
- [x] **BKM-02**: Back/forward buttons navigate through recently visited nodes
- [x] **BKM-03**: Recent nodes dropdown shows last 10 visited nodes for quick return
- [x] **BKM-04**: Keyboard shortcuts (1-9) jump to saved bookmarks

## Minimap (MAP-*)

- [x] **MAP-01**: Minimap panel shows bird's-eye overview of entire graph
- [x] **MAP-02**: Current viewport position is indicated on minimap
- [x] **MAP-03**: Clicking on minimap navigates to that position

## Breadcrumb Trail (BRD-*)

- [x] **BRD-01**: Breadcrumb trail shows hierarchy path from root to current node
- [x] **BRD-02**: Clicking breadcrumb segment navigates to that ancestor node

## Smooth Activity Updates (UPD-*)

- [x] **UPD-01**: Graph updates incrementally (add/remove nodes without full rebuild)
- [x] **UPD-02**: Camera position is preserved when files change (never reset)
- [x] **UPD-03**: Graph layout maintains stability when nodes are added/removed

## Enhanced Flash Effects (FLX-*)

- [x] **FLX-01**: Flash effects use brighter, more visible pulse/glow animations
- [x] **FLX-02**: Flash duration and intensity are configurable
- [x] **FLX-03**: Different flash patterns for create/modify/delete events

## Activity Trails (TRL-*)

- [x] **TRL-01**: Visual trails show recent activity flow through graph
- [x] **TRL-02**: Trail intensity fades over time (recent = bright, older = dim)
- [x] **TRL-03**: User can toggle activity trails on/off

## Tech Debt Notes

- **UPD-03**: Position fixing functions exist but not integrated with `applyIncrementalUpdate()`. Camera preservation masks the visual impact. Low severity.
